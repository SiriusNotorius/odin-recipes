    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p
      >The Mexican version of the cotoletta alla Milanese served on a bun
      dressed with South-of-the-Border fixings. Spicy breaded chicken breast
      gets sandwiched between a toasted Mexican bun then topped with spicy
      spread, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and pickled vegetables.</p
    >
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>⅓ cup bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 bolillo rolls, sliced in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Valentina®)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil</li>
      <li>½ avocado, sliced</li>
      <li>3 slices tomato</li>
      <li>2 lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pickled carrots </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pickled jalapeno peppers </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Step 1 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
      <li></li>
        Step 2 Seal chicken breast in a resealable zip-top plastic bag. Pound
        flat to 1/4-inch thickness. Add cornstarch and shake to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3 Whisk egg in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken breast through
        the egg; leave it in the bowl. Add bread crumbs, cilantro, chipotle,
        oregano, cumin, and pepper to the bag; shake well. Lift chicken from the
        bowl, letting any excess egg drip off. Add to the bread crumb mixture.
        Shake and press the seasoned bread crumbs over the chicken breast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4 Place bolillo buns in the preheated oven until warmed through and
        toasted, about 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5 Meanwhile, mix mayonnaise and hot sauce together in a small
        mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6 Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until
        browned, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut
        the chicken in half lengthwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 7 Assemble the sandwiches. Spread the spicy mayonnaise over both
        sides of the rolls. Add equal amounts of avocado, tomato, lettuce,
        carrots, and jalapenos to 2 halves. Add chicken and the tops of the
        rolls. Serve with the remaining spicy mayonnaise for dipping.
